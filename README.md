# steady-waffles
A RESTful file server written in Haskell

### What is does
- Services HTTP requests on port 31013 (could I be more random? Yes.) for files.
- It is recommended that you use the accompanying client
  - Coming Soon! (as of 21/10/15)

### What it isn't
- Redis, Riak, Voldemort, or some other crazy/fantastic database.
- Wreq, Snap, or another Haskell Web Framework.
  - We use one of them in the app
- Pristine code. This is a project to make something cool and useful.
  - But critque is welcome! And changes will be implemented!
- Using CABAL, because this package isn't intended for Haskell
  - Should there come a time, I'll rewrite the codebase anyway.
